# Read with Outline

(This is an unofficial extension. I'm not part of the Outline team.)

Click on the extension button to read the article in your current tab with Outline reader. I find Outline reader to be superior to many browsers' builtin reading view. Moreover, when you send a URL to Outline, it generates a public link you can share with others.
